punktiert
=========

particle library for p5/ processing

An architectural element is defined by its autopoietic condition and its operational virtue in an environment. This opens the possibility of an conscious threshold between the disposion of the object and the assembly of the object itself. The point of bifurcation between the whole and the perception of its constituting elements is named in social science as Punctualization (cp. punktiert).

Punktiert is a particle engine based and thought as an extension of Karsten Schmidt's toxiclibs.physics code. This library is optimized for the local negotiation between particles. And it allows hierarchies between multiple particle groups. The access and methods are simplified, no more difference between 2D/3D, extended behaviors.

This library is developed through and for an architectural context. Based on my teaching experiences over the past couple years.
